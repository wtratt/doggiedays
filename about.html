                Doggie Days connects pet owners with responsible, dog-loving students who have tons of energy and love to
                share with your pups.  Depending on your pet’s needs, we will assign someone willing to walk or run with
                your pet. We can also arrange group pet play at dog parks or care for your pet in your home when you are away.
                <br><br>

                100% of the proceeds go directly to the students, allowing you to pay lower prices while supporting local students.
                While we are a student run organization, we screen each pet carer for basic pet etiquette, behavioral best practices,
                emergency situation competency,  and reliability. Before choosing a carer for your pet, we encourage and will help
                arrange a meet & greet to ensure a great match between the pet owner, pet, and carer.

                How We Started
            </h1>
            <p>
                A busy third year MIT student that didn’t yet have time to get her own puppy, Wendy decided to find another
                way to spend time with dogs before she graduated. She tried dog walking apps, but the requests were often
                far away and required the pet owners to pay extra for the app service.
                <br><br>
                Wendy thought there must be a better way to spend time with dogs, and get some exercise while doing it,
                so she started Doggie Days as an experimnental project in March 2020, along with the help of a few of
                her friends.
